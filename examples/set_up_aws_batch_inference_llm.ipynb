    "\n",
    "### Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "| Label | Definition | Typical Triggers | Typical Non-Triggers |\n",
    "|-------|------------|------------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| **Positive** | Explicit documentation that the infant/patient **is currently receiving breast milk**, whether exclusively or mixed with other feeds. | “Breastfeeds every 3 h”, “Takes 30 mL expressed breast milk by bottle”, “Review of nutrition: breast and bottle” | Statements that only recommend or plan breastfeeding (*Absent / Insufficient Evidence*) |\n",
    "| **Negative** | Evidence that the infant/patient **is not currently receiving breast milk**. This includes exclusive formula feeding **or** statements that breastfeeding is historical or has been stopped/declined. | “Feeds Enfamil 60 mL q3h”, “Continue formula ad lib”, “Previously breastfed, now formula only”, “Mother stopped breastfeeding 2 weeks ago” | Any direct documentation of current breast-milk intake |\n",
    "| **Absent / Insufficient Evidence** | No clear evidence of current feeding with breast milk **or** formula; context is hypothetical, educational, uncertain, intentional, future plans, prescription, or ambiguous. Includes negated/historical/discontinued exclusive formula and unclear bottle-feeding statements. | “Last feed 2 h ago via bottle” (no milk type specified), “Breastfeeding is highly recommended”, “Family plans to breastfeed after discharge”, “Discussed exclusive formula feeding vs breastfeeding options” | Explicit statements of current exclusive formula feeding (*Negative*) or documented breast-milk intake (*Positive*) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Actual behavior vs. guidance**  \n",
    "   Recommendations, anticipatory guidance, or best-practice statements **do not count** as evidence of what was actually fed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nutrition-specific sections** often contain the relevant evidence. Pay extra attention to headings such as **“Review of Nutrition”, “Current Feeding”, “Feeding Difficulties” (but do not ignore other sections).**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pumping**\n",
    "    - If pumping is mentioned, look for evidence in addition to pumping that suggests the intent is to feed the patient or to build or maintain a milk supply. If there is additional information that suggests the intent of pumping is to feed the baby or build a milk supply (i.e., *not* dump it), classify the note as **positive**.\n",
    "    - If pumping is mentioned in conjunction with a lactation consultation, classify the note as **positive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Context matters**  \n",
    "   - Historical: \n",
    "      - If *breast milk* is mentioned ONLY as part of **past feeding behavior**, choose **Negative**\n",
    "      - If *formula* is mentioned ONLY as part of **past feeding behavior**, (e.g., 'sent home on') choose **Absent / Insufficient Evidence**\n",
    "   - Hypothetical: \n",
    "      - If *breast milk* is mentioned ONLY as a **recommendation, plan, or intended future behavior**, choose **Absent / Insufficient Evidence**.  \n",
    "      - If *formula* is mentioned ONLY as a **recommendation, plan, or intended future behavior**, choose **Absent / Insufficient Evidence**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the clinical note** thoroughly.  \n",
    "2. **Identify evidence** of current or past feeding behavior.  \n",
    "3. **Apply the context rules** to exclude purely hypothetical or advisory text.  \n",
    "4. **Assign the appropriate label**.  \n",
    "5. **Output** a JSON object.\n",
